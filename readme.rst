Zoob
====
Zoob is a 2D tank game for Android. All the game code is written in C++ with
the menus written in C. It is therefore able to run very well on old
devices like the HTC Magic (I developped it on a HTC Magic).

Some parts of the UI are in Java.

The master branch contains the source code for the version that is published
on the Market.
The net branch contains code for a multiplayer version that I never really
finished but is somehow working (it lacks a UI though :-) ).

Qt
--
Zoob can also run on the desktop thanks to its QT interface !
It is located in project/jni/qt/
