/**
 * A TextureGroup is a set of textures that should be loaded at the same time.
 * A group can be "locked" (its textures will be loaded) or "unlocked" (its textures
 * might be unloaded if memory is needed).
 * At every state change, different groups should be locked and unlocked, depending on
 * the state requirements. For example, if we have two states "playing" and "menu", we
 * could use two TextureGroups "playing" and "menu" that would be locked only when needed.
 *
 * The locking/unlocking of TextureGroup is handled by the TextureManager
