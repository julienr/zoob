/**
 * This class must be subclassed to implement the packet transport handling
 * For example, we'll have one subclass for libenet, one for bluetooth and so on
 *
 * Remark on peerID :
 * To provide a transport-agnostic identification of a peer, we use a uint64_t
 * as a unique identifier for a peer. This id is created and interpreted by the
 * underlying transport implementation.
 *
 * Remark on threading :
 * When we refer to a server thread, this is the thread that is used when doing
 * blocking networking i/o. This is as opposed to the game thread that handles
 * the logic and rendering
